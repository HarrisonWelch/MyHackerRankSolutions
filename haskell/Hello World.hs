-- Hello World.hs

-- A "Hello World" program has been widely adopted as the introductory
-- program for learning how to code. So, let's start functional 
-- programming by writing the same program.

-- Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
hello_world = -- Fill up this function
  putStrLn "Hello World" 

-- This part relates to Input/Output and can be used as it is. Do not modify this section
main = do
